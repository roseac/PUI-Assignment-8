                <P>Slovenians have been preparing Potica (po-teet-za) for centuries. The first mention of this traditional dish goes back to the 16th century, when it was recorded in the first book ever printed in the Slovenian language. It's a pastry reserved for festive occasions - Potica is served every Easter and Christmas in Slovenia and is still very popular even in some parts of the United States</P></div>

                <P>When speaking about Potica, it is almost impossible not to mention family. This traditional Slovenian festive cake is served on big holidays and celebrations. It is always made surrounded by family, with many hands working together to make the filling and spread the dough - and others chatting around the outer edges of the warm kitchen. Dough with different fillings is baked in a variation of a bundt pan and served at important holidays like Christmas and Easter. No important holiday is celebrated without traditional Potica. After many centuries, it still symbolizes a festive time when the whole family gathers at home. It brings out happy memories and hopes for a good future. When traveling in Slovenia, visitors should try this traditional dish to see why it has been and remains so important to the people of Slovenia. Many cookbooks offer recipes on how to prepare traditional Potica, but most households still make this traditional dish with the recipe that has been passed down in their family from generation to generation.</P></div>

                <P>Potica is baked in clay or metal baking moulds, round with a cylindrical protrusion in the middle, or spiraled in metal pans in the oven. There are over forty different kinds of fillings for Potica, but the most popular among the Slovenian natives are walnut, tarragon, honey, bacon, and carob. When potica first originated in Slovenia, the ingredients often told the story of the family baking it. Only wealthy families could afford expensive fillings such as nuts and cream and poorer families could typically only afford to include herbs from their garden.</P></div>

                <span class="padtop bhead">METHOD</span>
                <P id="method">1. For the dough, heat milk almost to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat; pour into large bowl. Add the butter, 1/2 cup of the sugar and salt. Set aside to cool. Stir yeast into warm water in a small bowl; stir in remaining 2 tablespoons of the sugar until dissolved. Set aside until foamy. <br> 2. Add yeast mixture to milk mixture. Beat in eggs with a mixer. Beat in flour, 1 cup at a time, just until dough can be handled without sticking. Knead dough on a floured board until very smooth, about 20 minutes. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl; cover. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours. (Do not knead dough after it has risen.).</P>
